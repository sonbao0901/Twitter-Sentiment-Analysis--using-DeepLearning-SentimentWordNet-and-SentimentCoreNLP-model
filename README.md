# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis--using-DeepLearning-SentimentWordNet-and-SentimentCoreNLP-model

Contact me if you need to run code cause I only upload the main code file (not the whole file).
I will preprocessing the tweets first. Remove all the symbol like @, ., !,... and link https... to have a Clean_Tweets
Then I will use that Clean_tweets to do sentiment analysis based on DeepLearning model, SentiWordNet model and SentimentCoreNLP model.
I'm not calculate the accuracy of those model cause there is no target at first so I gonna calculate the accuracy of those label from 3 models to see how many labels is the same.
